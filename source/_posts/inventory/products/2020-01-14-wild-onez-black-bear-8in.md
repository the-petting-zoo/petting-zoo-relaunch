Meet our friendly wild onez Black Bear. Shiny and soft, he is made from recycled materials and comes with a recycle symbol as a patch on his foot. Black bears like to live in forests, and eat a wide variety of food from berries to fish to sometimes even garbage. bears hibernate, sleeping when the weather turns cold.
