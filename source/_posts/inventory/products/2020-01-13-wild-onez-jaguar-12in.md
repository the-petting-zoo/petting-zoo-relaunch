Meet our wild onez Jaguar, the 3rd largest of the big cats, this guy loves to swim, and climb trees. They have a spotted coat that helps them hide in the rainforest. Did you know the jaguar has a stronger bite than a lion? Our plush piece is made of recycled materials, and features a recycled patch on his foot.
