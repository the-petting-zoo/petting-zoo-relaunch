Meet the world's largest predatory fish- the Great White Shark. Known to reach up to 20 feet in length, these seal hunters like warm seas and have a light colored belly to help them swim unseen. Our plush has a huge toothy grin, and is made of recycled materials. Comes with a recycle symbol patch on the hip.
