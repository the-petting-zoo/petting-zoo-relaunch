Hatchling turtles are baby sea turtles. The temperature of the egg determines if the hatchling will be a boy or a girl. Only 1 of 1000 hatchlings make it from the nest to the sea to mature turtles. Take yours home today! Also ask about our turtle in an egg, and additional sizes. This baby is made from recycled materials and comes with a recycle symbol.
