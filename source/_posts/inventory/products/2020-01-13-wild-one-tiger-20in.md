Meet our wild onez tiger, a member of the big cat family. Tigers are the largest of all the big cats, growing up to 11 feet. No two tigers share the same markings, and they can be found in Asia. Tigers are solo hunters, and they are currently endangered. Our Tiger is made of recycled materials, and comes with a recycled patch on his foot.
