Meet our wild onez Fawn, she is a baby, born with some very cute white spots. The mommy deer called the doe, goes looking for food while the fawn lays in the grass out of sight of predators keeping her safe. Our plush fawn is made of super soft recycled materials, and comes with a recycled symbol patch.
