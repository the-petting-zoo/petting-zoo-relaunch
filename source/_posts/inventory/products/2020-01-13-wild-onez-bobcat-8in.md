Meet our wild onez Bobcat, he sometimes goes by other names, like wild cat, and gets confused with a different cat called a lynx. You can spot him thanks to his pointed ear tufts, and large paws. He is an excellent climber, and comes from North America. Our piece is made of recycled materials, and featured a recycle symbol.
